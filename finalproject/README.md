# Bay Area Student Rentals
## Introduction
The project is an AirBnB for students in Bay Area. The difference is that the rental length is for the whole studying year (e.g. 2021-2022) instead of short-terms. It allows you to search for rentals, make enquiries and post your own properties. The platform allows any person to rent their whole properties, private or shared rooms for students for 21-22 college year.
