# Bay Area Student Rentals
## Introduction
The project is an AirBnB for students in Bay Area. The difference is that the rental length is for the whole studying year (e.g. 2021-2022) instead of short-terms. It allows you to search for rentals, make inquiries and post your own properties. The platform allows any person to rent the whole property, private or shared rooms for students for 21-22 college year.
